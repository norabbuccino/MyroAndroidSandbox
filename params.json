{"name":"MyroAndroidSandbox","tagline":"","body":"### Myro Scribbler for Android.\r\nWelcome to the webpage for the Myro Scribbler App for Android. This application was designed with the intent to bring about open source knowledge of integrating Android with MyroJava and the Scribbler robots. \r\n\r\nMuch of the base code, primarily the connection via Bluetooth and decoding the byte array commands between the Scribbler and Android (Base classes marked in comments at the top of each respective page), are accredited to this github repository: https://github.com/sahhhm/Scribdroid\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2014, under the direction of professor Douglas Harms (DePauw University), Alexander Miller (DePauw University, class of 2016) and Leonora Bresette-Buccino (Grinnell College, class 2016) extracted much of the base code from the above repository and created a custom application which offers more insight to the capabilities between MyroScribblers and Android.\r\n\r\nAll of the work provided in the summer of 2014 is thanks to a generous grant from the National Science Foundation and the REU program. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.  \r\nDouglas Harms: dharms@depauw.edu\r\n\r\nLeonora Bresette-Buccino: @norabbuccino, bresette@grinnell.edu\r\n\r\nAlexander Miller: @widowmaker110, alexandermiller_2016@depauw.edu, alexander.miller110@gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
